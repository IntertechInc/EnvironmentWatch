<h3>About Environment Watch</h3>

<p>
    Environment Watch is a simple MVC application that displays temperature, humidity, and
    light level data sent to this site from IoT devices. At the time this was published there
    was only one device that implemented this system: an ESP8266 module or the Adafruit Huzzah.
    Likely I'll be testing with the Raspberry Pi Zero next.
</p>

<p>
    While there are no crucial problems I am attempting to solve with this, there are some low level
    issues we've run into in our building.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The temperature in our office is inconsistent between floors or even in different areas on
        the same floor.
    </li>
    <li>
        The lights are not always turned off for the night. We don't have automatic lights, so it's
        up to the last person leaving to make sure they are turned off. Which they aren't always.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Both problems seemed like they'd be easier to understand with more data and from multiple locations.
    When were the lights turned off and where? What was the temperature on the second floor of the
    south side of the building during that one hot day in July?
</p>
<p>
    As such I had the idea to create multiple, inexpensive, devices that could all report to a single
    web application. This application then could be used to aggregate or view specific info and help
    better understand the problems and make decisions.
</p>

<p>
    The site currently includes no security, but nothing displayed seemed all that sensitive. While the
    site does allow upload of data by device, but requires a known ID for
    the device before logging anything.
